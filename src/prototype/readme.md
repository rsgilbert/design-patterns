# Prototype pattern

Create new objects by copying a prototype object.

When implementing the prototype pattern, you create an object and set default values for
its properties. Such an object with some of its properties specified is called a prototype. We can now clone this prototype object. The clones behave like newly constructed objects. 


You can also create a map of commonly used prototypes. Such a map is generally called a
prototype registry.
