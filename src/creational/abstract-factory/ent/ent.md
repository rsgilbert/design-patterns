# Abstract Factory for Entertainment

This is a project done after studying about abstract factory.

You can think of an abstract factory as a spider-leg-making machine. The set of methods for creating legs of the spider is the abstract factory, that is, SpiderLegFactory and 
each of its pairs of legs represents two different concrete implementations of a leg for a particular position such as front or hind.
For example, the hind legs have two concrete implementations, LeftHindLeg and RightHindLeg.

The spider has the left side and right side, each side represents a concrete factory, that is LeftSpiderLegFactory and RightSpiderLegFactory.
