# Bridge pattern

Also known as Handle/Body

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation
so that the two can vary independently.

The bridge is between the abstraction interface and the implementation interface.

The bridge pattern can also be used to split a class into two or more parts. By extracting out some properties of the class into their own class 
and then refering to them through a delegate object initialized by 
parameterizing the original class.

You can use the bridge pattern when you want to extend a class in
several independent directions but remember that the bridge pattern has to show the intent that it is linked between abstraction interface and 
implementation interface. Thats what bridge is about. Linking between an abstraction and its implementation.
