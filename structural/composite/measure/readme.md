# Measure

We can represent measure as a composite.

For example 2kg == 2000g == 2000000 milligrams

So we can add 1kg + 2g == 1002 g


Also:

1 dozen == 12 pieces 
1 caton == 30 pieces
1 dozen + 1 caton == 42 pieces 


To achieve this representation we use a base unit of measure.

For example caton can be our base unit of measure. In that way, we 
can represent dozen and pieces in form of catons by relying on an equivalence formula.

1 caton == 30 pieces
1 caton == 30 / 12 dozens

Whenever we make queries to these extra units of measure, the result should be given in form of base unit of measure.

Another form of measure can be currency.

For example 1 USD == 3500 UGX

In currencies we have a concept of local currency which is the default and the domestic/national currency.
